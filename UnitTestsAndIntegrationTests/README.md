# Travel Management API

This project is a RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core that manages airports, clients, and travel bookings using an in-memory database.

## Prompt
Create a C# project with three endpoints using an in-memory database. The endpoints should include:

Airport Endpoint (CRUD operations)
Client Endpoint (CRUD operations)
Travel Endpoint (CRUD operations for travel with client and airport information)
Additionally, the project should include:

Unit tests for all endpoints using the xUnit framework.
End-to-end integration tests (booking travel, editing travel, deleting travel, getting travel by flight).
Swagger setup for manual testing.
Detailed documentation in a README.md file.
Detailed Requirements:

Endpoints:

Airport Endpoint:
Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for airport data.
Client Endpoint:
Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for client data.
Travel Endpoint:
Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for travel data, including client and airport information.
Unit Tests:

Use the xUnit framework to create unit tests for all endpoints.
Ensure tests cover all CRUD operations.
Integration Tests:

Create end-to-end integration tests for the following scenarios:
Booking travel
Editing travel
Deleting travel
Getting travel by flight
Swagger Setup:

Configure Swagger for the project to enable manual testing of endpoints.

## Features

- CRUD operations for Airports
- CRUD operations for Clients
- CRUD operations for Travel bookings
- Swagger UI for API documentation and testing
- Unit tests using xUnit
- Integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
